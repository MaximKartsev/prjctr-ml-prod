# Stage 1

## Files 

- `data/train.csv`: The dataset
- `script/train_model.py`: Python script to train the regression model
- `model/trained_model.pkl`: Trained model
- `model/metrics.txt`: Metrics of the trained model
- `README.md`: README with information on how to reproduce the solution

## Steps to Reproduce in Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Create a new Notebook
3. Paste the script from the `script/train_model.py` file to the Notebook
4. Run the block of code
5. Colab will ask you to upload the file. Upload `data/train.csv` file
6. After execution will be finished download the model `trained_model.pkl` from the colab `content` folder
